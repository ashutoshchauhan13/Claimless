### Universal No Claim Bonus

As an insurance customer there is no easy way to demonstrate your personal claim history.

RESULT: There is no way to prove you are a good quality low risk customer to an insurance provider.

By transfering No Claim Bonus (NCB) tokens into a policy holders account when a policy expires, we will intrisically store the value of a customers claim history.

An insurance provider may choose to offer a discount on a policy in exchange for NCB tokens.

#### NCB tokens are NON-TRADEABLE
NCB tokens are created when a policy expires and destroyed when redeemed for a discount.

NCB tokens are issued at a standard rate which is directly linked the the premium of a policy. 1 NCB = £1.

The insurance provider determines the value of NCB tokens at the point of sale.

#### Process Flow
1. A potential customer owns 10 NCB tokens

2. An insurance provider chooses to offer a discount of 0.1% per NCB token on home contents insurance (could be anything).  With a maximum discount of 5% or 50 NCB.  NCB tokens will be payable on policy expiration (if no claim is made).

3. The customer chooses to redeem all 10 NCB tokens to purchase this policy.
The policy is for 1 year, original premium is £100 and the discounted premium is £99 = £100 - (0.1% * 10).
99 NCB tokens are payable if no claim is made.

4. The customer now has 0 NCB tokens.

5(i) Scenario 1 No Claim: 1 year later the policy expires without a claim being made. 99 NCB tokens created and are transfered to the customers account (Customer must request the tokens).

5(ii) Scenario 2 Claim made: No NCB tokens are created or transfer.  No action is required.

5(iii) Scenario 3 Policy cancelled: Insurer records the total amount of premium paid (if any).  If no claim has occured NCB tokens are created and transfered based on the actual premium paid.  Example: only £10 premium was collected before the policy was cancelled, no claims occured.  10 NCB tokens are created and transfered to the customer.
