### Universal No Claim Bonus

As an insurance customer there is no easy way to demonstrate your personal claim history.
RESULT: There is no way to prove you are a good quality low risk customer to an insurance provider.

By transfering No Claim Bonus (NCB) tokens into a policy holders account when a policy expires we will intrinsically store a value representing a customers risk profile. 

Insurance provides have the option to offer a discounted premium in exchange for NCB tokens.  
The value of an NCB token is determined by the insurance provider and can be used to attract customers to spesific lines of business.

### NCB TOKENS ARE NON-TRADABLE
Tokens are created when a policy expires and destroyed when redeemed.
