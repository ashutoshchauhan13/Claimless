### Universal No Claim Bonus

As an insurance customer there is no easy way to demonstrate your personal claim history.

RESULT: There is no way to prove you are a good quality low risk customer to an insurance provider.

By transfering No Claim Bonus (NCB) tokens into a policy holders account when a policy expires, we will intrisically store the value of a customers claim history.

An insurance provider may choose to offer a discount on a policy in exchange for NCB tokens.

#### NCB tokens are NON-TRADEABLE
NCB tokens are created when a policy expires and destroyed when redeemed for a discount.
NCB tokens are issued at a standard rate which is directly linked the the premium of a policy. 1 NCB = Â£1.
The insurance provider determines the value of NCB tokens at the point of sale.
