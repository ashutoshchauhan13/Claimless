### Universal No Claim Bonus

As an insurance customer there is no easy way to demonstrate your personal claim history.

RESULT: There is no way to prove you are a good quality low risk customer to an insurance provider.

By transfering No Claim Bonus (NCB) tokens into a policy holders account when a policy expires, we will intrisically store the value of a customers claim history.

An insurance provider may choose to offer a discount on a policy in exchange for NCB tokens.

#### NCB tokens are NON-TRADEABLE
NCB tokens are created when a policy expires and destroyed when redeemed for a discount.

NCB tokens are issued at a standard rate which is directly linked the the premium of a policy. 1 NCB = £1.

The insurance provider determines the value of NCB tokens at the point of sale.

#### Process Flow
1. A potential customer owns 10 NCB tokens

2. An insurance provider chooses to offer a discount of 0.1% per NCB token on home contents insurance (could be anything).  With a maximum discount of 5% or 50 NCB.  NCB tokens will be payable on policy expiration (if no claim is made).

3. The customer chooses to redeem all 10 NCB tokens to purchase this policy.
The policy is for 1 year, original premium is £100 and the discounted premium is £99 = £100 - (0.1% * 10).
99 NCB tokens are payable if no claim is made.
